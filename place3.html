	<center><h2>Historical Facts</h2></center>
	<p>1. Architecture The structure is built using a blend of both British and Mughal architecture which is known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, which is an architectural style which was followed in British India during the late 19th century.</p>
	<p>2. Angel of Victory The figure of 'Angel of Victory' is erected on the central dome of Victoria Memorial. Mounted on large ball bearings, the figure rotates with the wind.</p>
	<p>3. Galleries at Victoria Memorial There are 25 galleries in Victoria Memorial. The galleries include the sculpture gallery, the royal gallery, the central hall, the portrait gallery, the arms and armoury gallery and the Calcutta gallery. The other exhibits of the museum include coins, stamps and maps of those times.</p>
	<p>4. Funded by the People of India This massive structure was funded by Indians. Donations were called from all over the country, and the amount collected was used for the construction of this spectacular memorial. The British government also partly funded the structure.</p>
	<p>5. Decolonisation after Indian Independence As a part of decolonisation after 1947, many of the statues erected by the British all over India were either removed, replaced by Indian ones or moved to the garden of Victoria Memorial.</p>
