	<center><h2>Historical Facts</h2></center>
	<p>	1.  This fort obtains it’s name from the red sandstone and brick boundary walls which were used to fortify the complex.</p>

	<p>	2.  The fort was originally called Qila-i-Mubarak (the Blessed Fort), which was colloquially changed to ‘Lal Qila’ because of its tall red enclosure walls and eventually titled the ‘Red Fort’.</p>

	<p>	3.  Building of this fort took 10 years, as construction began in May 1638 and was finally completed only in April 1648 under the instruction of Emperor Shah Jahan.</p>

		<p>4.  The architect who designed this fort, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, was the same person who designed the Taj Mahal.</p>

	<p>	5.  Unlike other Mughal forts, the enclosure walls of this fort are asymmetrical so as to accommodate the older fort, Salimgarh. An aerial view reveals the almost octagonal shape of the boundary walls.</p>

		<p>6.  Another unique and important structure within this complex was ‘Rang Mahal’, which was named after its very colourful interiors with mosaic mirrors. This building housed the Emperor’s wives and mistresses and had a marble pool.</p>

	<p>	7.  The creative and unique architectural style of the fort and it’s gardens, influenced the construction style of many buildings and gardens built in later days in Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Kashmir and many other cities.</p>

	<p>	8.  After the Mughal rule ended, the British systematically looted and destroyed the forts palaces, harems, gardens and took into possession the Kohinoor diamond, the Jade wine cup of Shah Jahan, the crown of Bahadur Shah and other precious artwork. Many of these precious items are located in London currently.</p>

	<p>	9.  The last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II was tried for treason in this very Red fort and was later exiled to Rangoon.</p>

	<p>	10.  The fort had two main entrances for the public, the Lahore gate and the Delhi gate. The Lahore gate is currently the main entrance to the fort and was named so at that time, because of its orientation towards Lahore in Pakistan, when it was still a part of undivided India.</p>
